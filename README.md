## BigInt C++ ##
Implements a BigInt class in C++. Uses a vector to store decimal digits. Simple addition and multiplication O(n^2). 

Allows for arbitrarilly large factorial calculations (large memory demand). 
Benchmarked faster than I thought, 1000! in 0.078 s (CPU time). (1000! is over 2000 digits long).

bigfactorial.cpp uses Memoization to calculate factorial.
